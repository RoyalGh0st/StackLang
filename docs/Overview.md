## Overview

StackLang is a language based off of manipulating stacks. EVERYTHING is a stack. To affect memory stacks (number stacks and
string stacks), you set an instruction stack slot to have your desired instruction. A pointer moves up the instruction stack, and 
its direction can be changed by an instruction on the instruction stack. In this sense, StackLang is a procedural language, in that
instructions are done in the order that they appear to the pointer. I like to call it a fluid-procedural language.
