# ILang\*

\* ILang as in the ninth letter of the alphabet <br>
Not a very original name,  but whatever.
<br>

ILang is a functional object language, a term I coined myself (at least I think I did). It is based off of closed objects and 
piping. Each object has its own specific functions. Data is sent through channels linking objects, and the data is only
available to the object it is sent to and sent from. This is done in the hopes of ultimate modularization, in which objects can be
added and removed without consequence.
