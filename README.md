# Contribution

If you want to contribute to the interpreter, edit in the <code>interpreter-unconfirmed</code> branch. <br>
If you want to contribute to the documentation, edit in the <code>docs-unconfirmed</code> branch.
<br><br>
Only submit code if you're pretty certain it will work. Also, please provide documentation for or inside your code, as it is much
easier for everyone else.

Thank you!
