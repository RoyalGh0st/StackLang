# ILang\*

\* ILang as in the letter I <br>
Not a very original name,  but whatever.

ILang is a functional/object oriented language. Everything you use is an object, and every function you use is attached to an 
object. Objects can be linked to each other, but no inheritance, because linking objects gives the linked objects access to each
other linked object's functions, unless an object has the property "NO_SHARE_FUNC" enabled. You can also choose which functions to
not share.
