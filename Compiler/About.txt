About the ILang compiler
========================

The ILang compiler is the first stage of handling an I program. The compiler has two stages: parsing, converting, and compiling. 
The parsing stage creates a list of tokens from the input text, and the conversion stage converts this token list into intermediate
code. After the intermediate code is generated, the compilation stage converts this intermediate code into C code, which is then
compiled using the latest GCC version.
